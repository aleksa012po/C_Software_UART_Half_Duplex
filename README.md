# C_Software_UART_Half_Duplex

Description
C_Software_UART_Half_Duplex project is a software UART implementation for Atmel AVR microcontrollers. 
It enables serial communication using timer interrupts and provides functions 
for data transmission and reception. Ideal for projects requiring software-based 
UART communication with external devices.

Features
- Simple and lightweight UART implementation
- Supports data transmission and reception
- Utilizes timer interrupts for precise timing
- Compatible with Atmel AVR microcontrollers
- 
Usage
1. Include "uart_setup.c" in your project.
2. Initialize UART using the U_Init() function.
3. Use U_TxByte() to transmit data and U_RxByte() to receive data.
4. Refer to the example code provided for more details.
